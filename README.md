# Etch-a-sketch

The first big project putting into work a lot of the DOM manipulation and event handling learned in the past few lessons, as well as lots of content from previous lessons. 

-- What worked well?

    - Explaining the project in small steps first, taking one small part of it and figuring out how this would work, playing with empty HTML/CSS to visualise how this could work,             before heading to JS to actually write this code using DOM manipulation and event handling. I felt more confident in 'linking' the various functions, to transform them from the         basic individual functions, to actually work with user input/other functions to put the little parts all together.  

-- What would you do differently?

  - The biggest challenge was transforming my original 'static' grid into a grid of varying number of squares, specifically the Flexbox aspect. This highlighted that my knowledge of        flexbox is not yet complete (and I assume never will be) but I would like to try to spend more time researching various flexbox features as well as refreshing on the various flex       values before diving into code.  This can feel very  difficult at times when hours go by and it feels like nothing has changed, but I would like to try to spend more time               explaining to myself what I think the outcome would/should be of an attempt of code, rather than guessing and amending each line/section bit by bit to hope that I will reach     the desired outcome.
    
  - It seems forEach is a very powerful Array/object tool which simplifies a lot of things, so would like to get more familiar with this for next projects.
    
  - Few hiccups with checking user input from 'prompt' and accidentally going down a rabbit hole of comparing null and undefined in mathematical comparison operators. learning to avoid this and using Number()/isNaN to avoid where possible, while still effectively checking.
    
  - I'd also like to try to further understand how the 'return' line works in functions as well as a refresher on while/do..while loops as most practice sessions I used for so would be good to brush up on the usage of the other loops.
    
  - Understand the event object in more detail - what it consists of and ways to use it.
    

-- How will you change the way you approach things? 
  - Take each step in one, without overthinking possible complications down the line of making these parts work together. Most of the time these get resolved on their own.
  - As well as explaining each part to myself and writing pseudo before coding, also think about which parts/functions/methods will need to be used and refresh myself on these before starting.
  - Whenever I am stuck or something is not working as expected, explain the current code to myself step by step in terms of what I expect to happen to help locate the issue and understand what the code is actually doing. If I am unable to explain line by line,  then I need reach out for help/research specifics further, as I will be unable to add/amend the code further if I don't know exactly what it's doing.
